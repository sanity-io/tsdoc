/**
 * @beta
 *
 * The summary section should be brief. On a documentation web site,
 * it will be shown on a page that lists summaries for many different
 * API items.  On a detail page for a single item, the summary will be
 * shown followed by the remarks section (if any).
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * The main documentation for an API item is separated into a brief
 * "summary" section optionally followed by an `@remarks` block containing
 * additional details.
 *
 * Unlike the summary, the remarks block may contain lengthy documentation
 * content.  The remarks should not restate information from the summary,
 * since the summary section will always be displayed wherever the remarks
 * section appears.  Other sections (e.g. an `@example` block) if shown
 * will usually appear after the remarks section.
 *
 * Code samples can be enclosed in a Markdown code fence:
 * ```ts
 * function getAverage(x, y) {
 *   return (x + y) / 2.0;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * If you use special symbols and don't want to use a code span, you can
 * escape them using backslashes:  \{\@inheritDoc Button.render\}
 *
 * @example
 * Code samples can be enclosed in a Markdown code fence:
 * ```ts
 * function getAverage(x, y) {
 *   return (x + y) / 2.0;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @sampleCustomBlockTag
 *
 * You can define your own custom block tags and tell the parser about them.
 * The playground doesn't render this block, but your own tooling could do that.
 *
 * @privateRemarks
 *
 * The `@privateRemarks` tag starts a block of additional commentary that is not meant
 * for an external audience.  A documentation tool must omit this content from an
 * API reference web site.  It should also be omitted when generating a normalized
 * *.d.ts file.
 *
 * Modifiers look like block tags, but they do not start a documentation block.
 * For example this `@sealed` tag tells us that nobody should inherit from the
 * class.  But if text appeared after it, that text would get attached to the
 * previous block.
