## How to Release

The only thing you should need to do is to merge into the `main` branch.
The release actions after merging should do the rest.

Make sure that you also don't only have chore commit messages

**Note: If you squash and merge make sure that your PR title is named according to the semantic messages so that the sematic release can happen automatically. Otherwise you'll have to amment the commit message to an appropriate one**
